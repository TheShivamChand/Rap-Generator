<h2>Rap-Generator</h2>

Created a Rap Generator using basic python. It generates random words from the lyrics of "Apna Time Aayega" and we converted the text into mp3 file using Google Text-to-Speech(gTTS).<br>
We used <b>numpy</b> and <b>gTTS</b> libraries.<br>
*numpy* library was used to generate random words from the txt file and to choose the upcoming character.<br>
*gTTS* was used to covert the generated new text we had into mp3 format.<br>
